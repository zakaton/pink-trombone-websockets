wordplay
  input word and it gives rhymes, similar words, puns...
  alliteration
  "bars" for lyrics
  find nearest word phonemes given other phonemes, e.g. "rise" and "rice"
  attempt to pronounce non-words (e.g. license plates)
  puns (find overlap between words, e.g. pun+funny => punny - use to make "startup" names)
  generate mispelled words (take regular word, then note how phonemes can be spelled, e.g. replace "f" with "gh" as in "rough" => "rouff" => "ruff")
  figure out how to make a {phoneme: [...possible spellings]} and VV, e.g. {f: ["f", "gh"]}
  find words inside other words, like "I need a" in "Anita"
  play with suffixes/prefixes to words, like "go" and "un-go", when we have explicit words like "stop", or "upload" and "unload", where we assume a prefix like "up" in "upload" (taking the first syllable)
shape manipulation (orbit object, scale, move around... - 'z' to toggle maipulation modes)
SFX (make wind or ocean sound by making the similar sound)
Make up a language? (custom phonemes, words, morphology, syntax, lexicon)
Scrabble, but with phonemes?
use markov chain to not only mkae up giberish, but convert it back to english (mapping from english characters/strings to phonemes, e.g. "ch" maps to that "tj" symbol, or simple r to r, where you can give it a random word and it can predict how to pronounce it, e.g. chophouse, being cho-pho-use vs chop-house) - can also make up english words using a markov chain and guess the pronunciation

NICE TO HAVES
  pink-trombone
    add "easing" feature to keyframes, allowing for quick changes (e.g. voiceness change)
  pronunciation
    eye-tracking to "read" words and they're spoken aloud
  knn
    "include in training" checkboxes for /knn classes (can "mute" some classes, or "solo" others)
    checkboxes to send to PT/game/robot/etc in /knn 
  tts
    emotion (happy, sad, sarcastic, etc)
    "filter" button (takes phonemes and replace with similar phonemes, like a substitution button you can re-press multiple times like re-doing image filters), e.g. "blur", "mumble", etc
    contrast in phonetic substitutions (find constriction differences between 2 versions of a single word, and exaggerate the difference in one direction, e.g. a british english mocking an american english accent or vv, where you can hear how different accents perceive each other)
    smooth-out phonemes, e.g. "is this" => "iz zis", where the sudden change of voice/voiceless smooths out, or tongue-twisters that alternate between similar phonemes "really likes" to "lilly rikes", switching particular phonemes
    similar words (get phonetic difference between words, and calculate distance between phonemes by constriction values), and syllables/rhymes (use same number of syllables to make a new "bar"), and apply autocorrect?
    blank keys for song placeholders (retain syllables and fill in phonemes (or phoneme classes/rhymes, or sub-phrases like regex for phonemes) - useful for songs or setting words to a beat)
    for consonants like h/k/m, use the next vowel to determine where to put the tongue
    add timeDelta to multi-consonant phonemes themselves for pre-set timing
    speed can affect the phonemes (speaking slowly "over-anunciates", and quickly removes phonemes)
    can add "umms" randomly, or mix up phonemes, e.g. "downstairs" to "sound-dairs"
    find "cross-homophones", where mapping the english.txt through a phonetic substitution/accent can be interpreted as a different word in the orignal voice, e.g. "keys" can sound like "kiss" when sounding...italian?
    drop phonemes if the end of one word is the same/similar to the next, e.g. "next time" to "necks I'm"
    pronounce things literally, e.g. "store" as "story" because it ends in "e" (like how children read stuff incorrectly because of arbitrary rules), or "th" in Thomas instead of saying it like "Tomas"
    Pronunciation like commas, which change the pitch temporarily (The ball, which is red, bounced), or a question mark can change inflection of the last word
    given multiple languages, one can map a word in one language to its phonemes, and then to another language's words (or find the closest words in the other language to see how it can be interpreted) - can be useful to see how words can be interpreted by others who don't know (or make double meaning if bilingual)
    Use syntax to break a sentence down into a tree, figuring which words to emphasize (e.g. the subject of a sentence), and adding the ability to map poses in animation to certain words that can be re-ordered when translated to different languages with different word order - can also add typography to the words for simpler emphasis (bold, italic, underline, color), which can affect the pitch, speed, duration...
