    "include in training" checkboxes for /knn classes (can "mute" some classes, or "solo" others)
    checkboxes to send to PT/game/robot/etc in /knn 
  tts
    "filter" button (takes phonemes and replace with similar phonemes, like a substitution button you can re-press multiple times like re-doing image filters), e.g. "blur", "mumble", etc
    contrast in phonetic substitutions (find constriction differences between 2 versions of a single word, and exaggerate the difference in one direction, e.g. a british english mocking an american english accent or vv)
    smooth-out phonemes, e.g. "is this" => "iz zis", where the sudden change of voice/voiceless smooths out, or tongue-twisters that alternate between similar phonemes "really likes" to "lilly rikes", switching particular phonemes
    similar words (get phonetic difference between words, and calculate distance between phonemes by constriction values), and syllables/rhymes (use same number of syllables to make a new "bar"), and apply autocorrect?
    blank keys for song placeholders (retain syllables and fill in phonemes (or phoneme classes/rhymes, or sub-phrases like regex for phonemes) - useful for songs or setting words to a beat)
