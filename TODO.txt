    "filter" button (takes phonemes and replace with similar phonemes, like a substitution button you can re-press multiple times like re-doing image filters), e.g. "blur", "mumble", etc

    smooth-out phonemes, e.g. "is this" => "iz zis", where the sudden change of voice/voiceless smooths out, or tongue-twisters that alternate between similar phonemes "really likes" to "lilly rikes", switching particular phonemes
